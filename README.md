🛒 Soukarya Commerce: 
Advanced React JS Storefront & State Management

A high-performance E-commerce frontend built with React 19, featuring complex state logic, smooth animations, and seamless API integration. This project demonstrates my ability to build scalable, user-centric interfaces with professional-grade state management.

#) Frontend Highlights (React JS)
1) Custom Cart Engine: Engineered a centralized logic handler (soukaryaCartManager) to manage adding, incrementing, and removing items with zero-latency UI updates.
2) Dynamic UI Controls: Implemented a "Single Card" quantity toggle (+ 0 -) that provides instant feedback to users without navigating away from the products.
3) State Persistence & Routing: Integrated React Router for multi-page navigation while maintaining cart state across the application.
4) Modern Animations: Used Framer Motion for "pop-layout" transitions and card-hover effects to enhance the premium feel of the shop.
5) Tailwind 4.0 Styling: Fully responsive, utility-first design ensuring a perfect experience from mobile to ultra-wide monitors.

Technical Stack:

Frontend: 

1) React 19 & Vite: Utilizing the latest React features for optimal performance.

2) Axios: Handling asynchronous data fetching from the FakeStore API.

3) Framer Motion: Managing complex entry/exit animations for cart items.
